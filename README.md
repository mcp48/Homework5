# Project Description
This project is a homework assignment to teach how to get Pycharm setup with Docker, Flask, MYSQL.  This part of the project introduces the use of forms to update, edit, and delete records.
<p>This part of the project uses my own data based on the mlb_players CSV data file taken from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html.  The data in this repository was edited from the original data to show only 100 records, as opposed to the over 1000 records in the original file.</p>
